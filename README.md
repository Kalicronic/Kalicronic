# Hi, Iâ€™m Kalicronic

A lot of education and self-study, with a lot of fun along the way, has brought me to my passion programming.
I learned in C++ and Java. Privately, I also got into game development and discovered Unity and C# for myself.
In my free time, I'm also into programming, gaming, skateboarding and playing guitar to expand my skills.

Right now I'm also working on my game [Project Terraforming](https://github.com/Kalicronic/Project_Terraforma) and 2 mapping projects for Skater XL.
