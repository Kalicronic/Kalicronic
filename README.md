# Hi, Iâ€™m Benny

A lot of education and self-study, with a lot of fun along the way, has brought me to my passion, programming. 
Very supportive is my successfully completed studies with a Bachelor of engineering in telematics.
I learned in C++ and Java. Privately, I also got into game development and discovered Unity with C# and Blender for myself.
In my free time, I'm also into programming, gaming, skateboarding and playing guitar to expand my skills.


## Projects:
In the last 4 years I had many small projects to learn. Some finished, some unfinished. I try with time to upload them here too.

Right now I'm also working on my game [Project Terraforming](https://github.com/Kalicronic/Project_Terraforma) and 2 mapping projects for Skater XL.

Last year I published the Skater XL map "[Berlin Hellersdorf - Wall](https://skaterxl.mod.io/berlin-hellersdorf-wall)" on mod.io.
